MinIO instance supports SQL-style SELECT command and API support via its MinIO
Client (`mc`) and language bindings.

See [MinIO Select API Quickstart Guide](https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-select-api-quickstart-guide.html).

objects in uncompressed and compressed formats. No extra configuration is
required.
